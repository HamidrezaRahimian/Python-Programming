Behold! I've summoned the mighty SpellChecker to help us slay the dragon of misspelled words in our digital kingdom. But, here's the epic twist: hoohahahahaa #evil_laugh_emoji 

```python
from spellchecker import SpellChecker

def correct_spelling(text):
    spell = SpellChecker()

    # Split the text into words hohahahaaa
    words = text.split()

    # Identify misspelled words ()unkown word in text will be considered as misspelled
    misspelled = spell.unknown(words)

    # lets Correct the misspelled words baby!________________________________________________
    #make a list to save the corrected word inside
    corrected_text = []

    for word in words:
        if word in misspelled: #misspelled = spell.unknown(words)
            corrected_text.append(spell.correction(word))
        else:
            corrected_text.append(word)
   # miss spelled correction is done_________________________________________________________
            
    # Join the corrected words back into a sentence
    return " ".join(corrected_text)
```

Our wizardry is working, but hold onto your magic wands because here's the spell-checker's favorite prank: it's not ignoring code snippets! Oh, the irony! Our spell-checker insists on casting its spell even on the sacred code texts. So, while it's making our prose pristine, it's also waving its wand at our Python spells.

Now, who said magic was straightforward, right? Let's brainstorm together to make our spell-checker skip the code and focus on the real wordplay. The magical journey continues!
