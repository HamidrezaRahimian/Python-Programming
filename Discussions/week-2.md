When examining DRAM energy consumption, the top five languages with the lowest energy consumption are C, Rust, C++, Ada, and Java, with only Java not being compiled. The bottom five, with higher energy consumption, are Lua, JRuby, Python, Perl, and Ruby, all interpreted languages.
 On average, compiled languages consume less energy than virtual machine or interpreted languages.
